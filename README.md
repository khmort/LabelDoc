## ‚ú® Features
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
- No external dependencies (pure Swing application)  
- Easy-to-use interface for drawing bounding boxes on images  

---

## üöÄ Planned Features
- **Smart box refinement**:  
  Users can draw rough bounding boxes quickly, and built-in functions will automatically refine them for higher accuracy.  

- **Weak-to-strong training workflow**:  
  - Use pre-trained weak models to auto-generate bounding boxes.  
  - Label dataset semi-automatically.  
  - Retrain the model iteratively to improve detection quality.

## üõ† Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- No additional libraries needed
